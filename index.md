## When
The 11th Opencast conference will be hosted from 5-7 February 2020 at Ghent University in Belgium.

## About the conference
The Opencast community is an international collaboration of individuals, higher education institutions and organisations working together to discuss, develop, define and document best practices for the management of audiovisual content in academia.

The conference is dedicated to the use and management of academic video in general and Opencast in particular.

While the focus of the event will be on Opencast, the community seeks participation from related domains and projects. We are therefore inviting educational designers, researchers, services providers and others working with video in academic settings to share expertise and experience across the field and explore opportunities to collaborate in related projects.

## Participate

If you are interested in participating, please have a look at (the call for proposals)[https://oc2020.ugent.be/cfp.html] .
