## When
The 11th Opencast conference will be hosted from 5-7 February 2020 at Ghent University in Belgium.

## Where
The conference takes place at the Campus Coupure of Ghent University, the main campus of our Faculty of Bioscience Engineering.

More information about the venue and how to get to Ghent is available at the [venue](https://oc2020.ugent.be/venue.html) page.

## About the conference
The Opencast community is an international collaboration of individuals, higher education institutions and organisations working together to discuss, develop, define and document best practices for the management of audiovisual content in academia.

The conference is dedicated to the use and management of academic video in general and Opencast in particular.

While the focus of the event will be on Opencast, the community seeks participation from related domains and projects. We are therefore inviting educational designers, researchers, services providers and others working with video in academic settings to share expertise and experience across the field and explore opportunities to collaborate in related projects.

We're thrilled to announce this year's keynote speakers **Emily Nordmann** and **Margret Plank** , see the [programme](https://oc2020.ugent.be/programme.html) !
