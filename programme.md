## Keynote speakers

We're thrilled to announce this year's keynote speakers **Emily Nordmann** and **Margret Plank**!


### Emily Nordmann

Emily Nordmann is a lecturer in the School of Psychology, University of Glasgow, UK. Emilyâ€™s main area of pedagogical research is lecture capture and how it impacts learning although her discipline research deals with psycholinguistics, in particular idiomatic expressions and swearing. Previously she was a Lecturer (Scholarship) in the School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen. During her career, Emily has centred the development of her teaching activities on the application of eLearning tools and now conducts pedagogical research with a focus on the use of lecture capture in higher education.
