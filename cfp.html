<h2>Call for proposals</h2>
<p>The Opencast community is preparing for its annual meeting at Ghent University, February 5-7 2020. This conference marks the 11th anniversary of the Opencast community which was launched as project "Matterhorn" by UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>For the meeting in February, the Opencast community is looking for contributions related to the use and management of video in academia. With a focus on Opencast, course capture and video management, we are particularly keen to hear from educational technologists and designers, instructors or service providers working with video to support teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The call is open for suggestions too. If you have a topic you would like to know more about or discuss with others, feel free to submit a proposal and have the conference committee organize a session for you.</p>
