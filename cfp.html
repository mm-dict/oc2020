<h2>Call for proposals</h2>
<p>The Opencast community is an international collaboration of individuals,
  higher education institutions and organizations working together to discuss,
  develop, define and document best practices for the management of audiovisual content in academia.</p>

<p>The annual Opencast summit will be hosted at Ghent University, 5-7 February 2020.</p>

<p>The conference is dedicated to the use and management of academic video in general and Opencast in particular.
While the focus of the event will be on Opencast, the community seeks participation from related domains and projects.</p>

<p>We are therefore inviting educational designers, researchers, service providers
  and others working with video in academic settings to share expertise and
  experience across the field and explore opportunities to collaborate in related projects.  </p>

<h2>Tracks</h2>
<p>The conference committee is looking for proposals in three tracks:</p>

<h3>1 - Academic video</h3>
<ul>
<li>Teaching and learning with video, pedagogy of video, learning analytics</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Video strategies and policies</li>
</ul>

<h3>2 - Opencast user track</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience in using Opencast for lecture capture/video management</li>
<li>Ideas for new features in Opencast</li>
<li>Solutions to further develop Opencast</li>
<li>Integration scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h3>3 - Opencast developer track</h3>
<ul>
<li>Presentations and meetings with a focus on technical details, likely to see
  developers, system administrators, A/V-technicians and those interested in issues related to these domains.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal types</h2>
<p>There are different types of proposals for these tracks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightning talk: 15 minutes including 5 minutes Q&A</li>

</ul>

<br/>

<p>Alternatively, feel free to suggest a BoF or a workshop for a topic
